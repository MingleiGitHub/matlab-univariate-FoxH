# matlab-univariate-FoxH
This includes the univariate Fox H function implemented in Matlab
the test script calculates the PDF of the Rayleigh distribution with 0 mean
and unit variate in the form of univariate Fox H function and in its 
simplified representation.
The difference between the two calculations is one the level of 1e-14.

For details regarding the univariate Fox H function and its related
issues, please refer to the book of "H Function: theory and
application"

For details between other PDF/CDF/MGF of fading channels
and their Fox H representations, please refer to the paper and reference
therein.
